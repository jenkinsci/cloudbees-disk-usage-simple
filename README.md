This is a simple disk usage plugin that calculates disk usage while limiting the performance impact on the Jenkins master.

# Features
* uses Java 7 NIO directory walker API to calculate the size of jobs and 1st level directories under `$JENKINS_HOME`
* throttle the directory scan to help prevent the load average from climbing too high
* a refresh of usage data is automatically launched when you display the screen and they are older than 15 minutes
* a refresh of usage data can be also manually requested, but only one at a time will occur

To use this plugin visit the `Manage Jenkins` -> `Disk usage` page.
